		<p>Dragons are Istaria's flagship race. Its entire marketing is based around them, so to play one, you must be really good and know how to do everything right or else you die, correct? Actually, no - dragons are notoriously easy to level and understand. Unlike bipeds, who have nearly fifty schools combined between adventure and crafting, dragons only have one adventure school and three crafting schools. They have a very smooth set path for leveling if you follow ability quests. They also gain the power of flight - an extremely useful skill for traverseing terrain - quite early. If you are new to Istaria, the best place to start learning the game is certainly a dragon. Without further ado, let's begin.</p>
		<p>The first thing to know when starting up a dragon is that you are strong. In lower levels, be careful not to overestimate yourself, but your power scales up dramatically as you unlock new scale slots and upgrade your equipment. When you start, you may struggle to take down even the little grulets in Skalkaar, but by level thirty you can easily smack down level fifties if you know how to work your abilities. Level fifties and sixties can take down the highest level enemies in the game, shy of epics. As a group, dragons are unstoppable. Alone, they’re still formidable. Take advantage of that!</p>
		<p>That being said, the second thing to be aware of is what path you want to take. There’s multiple ways to level a dragon; they only have one adventure school and one primary craft school and thus are considerably easier than the much squishier and more complex bipeds. Do you want to not bother with upgrading your scales as you go and wish to slaughter enemies even at level one? Level your craft to eighty or ninety first and equip tier five scales - nothing will stand in your way for a very long time. Hate crafting and just want to run ahead? That works too. Dragons are notoriously flexible when it comes to leveling strategies; make use of that!</p>
		<p>Regardless of what crafting path you take, leveling adventure is very similar all the same. Before we delve into the actual leveling aspect of playing a dragon, let's consider the basic build mechanics and how setting up your training points and scales works.</p>
		<a name="build"><header class="subsection border">Making a Basic Build</header></a>
			<p>Before we start, let’s cover their basic statistics and skills so you understand what you’re looking at in your training points window. We go far more in detail with this on the <a href="http://istaraschosen.com/guides/dragonbuilds.html">Dragon Build Guides</a> page, so check that out if that is more what you’re looking for. This is a simple overview!</p>
				<a name="tp"><header class="subsection border">Training Points</header></a>
				<p>The first encounter with creating a build you will have is with your training points. Training points are points that you can spend in exchange for certain statisics. Listed below are the available stats you can skill.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Strength:</b> Directly increases physical damage. Costs 4 points.</li>
					<li><b>Power:</b> Directly increases magic damage. Costs 4 points.</li>
					<li><b>Primal:</b> Increases damage of spells that use the primal skill. (Essentially all dragon spells) Costs 3 points.</li>
					<li><b>Tooth and Claw:</b> Increases damage of physical attacks that use the tooth and claw skill. (Essentially all attacks) Costs 3 points.</li>
					<li><b>Dexterity:</b> Increases your to-hit chance with physical abilities and decreases an enemy's. Costs 4 points.</li>
					<li><b>Focus:</b> Increases your to-hit chance with magic abilities and decreases an enemy's. Costs 4 points.</li>
					<li><b>Health:</b> Directly increases your health pool. Costs 1 point.</li>
					<li><b>Evasion:</b> Increases your chance to dodge an enemy's physical attack. Costs 3 points.</li>
					<li><b>Magic Evasion:</b> Increases your chance to dodge an enemy's magical attack. Costs 3 points.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>From this list, you'll notice two major distinctions: magic and physical damage. Depending on what you want to play as - a dragon spellcaster (henceforth referred to as 'caster') or a physical attacker/melee dragon (melee) - you will want to skill specific stats related to it. If you are a melee-focused character, then don't put anything in primal, power, or focus. Regardless of which category you are looking for, do not skill anything into the evasions, dexterity, or focus - these statistics are largely useless to you and do not make enough of a notable difference in my testing.</p>
			<p>Especially when leveling, the unique statitic health is very useful to skill. If you put a lot of points into health, you will directly see those points returned as hitpoint. 600 training points into health means 600 hit points.</p>
			<p>Keep in mind when skilling statistics that you can only ever place half of your maximum points into one category, limiting you to fully filling two bars.</p>
			<p>Knowing all of this, now, here are the usual primary statistics that you will likely focus on. As a <i>melee</i>, you will likely skill strength, tooth and claw, and health. Focus on health if you want survivability, and otherwise focus on a split between strength and tooth and claw if you want to be more of a glass cannon.</p>
			<p>Similarly, for <b>casters</b>, focus on power, primal, and health. For <b>hybrids</b> (dragons that use both spells and melee skills interchangeably), you will want to strike a balance between the two. Hybrids become more viable the higher level you are, as you can diversify your scale stats and eventually use tier six scales, so it may be better to focus on one side of the spectrum until you are around mid tier.</p>
				<a name="scales"><header class="subsection2 border">Scales and Claws</header></a>
					<p>Dragon armor pieces are known as scales, which cover ten portions of the body. You unlock a new scale slot every ten levels, starting with the chest at level 1. Subsequently, you unlock your first wing, head, second wing, first foreleg, first hindleg, second foreleg, second hindleg, back, and tail slots in that order.</p>
					<p>Dragon weapons are known as claws, and come in only one variety, upgrading every few levels. Contrary to popular belief, according to the developer AmonGwareth, claws <i>do not adjust your damage output</i> despite the damage listed on the claw. All it does is provide a weapon to place weapon-based techniques on, so not stress too much about upgrading your claw every time you can. Once a tier is fine, or even less.</p>
					<p><b>Scales</b></p>
						<p>Let us focus on scales first. Scales follow a pattern - each scale offers a +X boost to a particular attribute, as well as a base +Y armor increase. The "X" attribute can be any of the following: strength, power, focus, dexterity, armor, or health. As mentioned prior with training points, completely disregard focus and dexterity.</p>
						<p>As with your build, you will want to choose a type of scale based on your build's primarily attribute. Now, here you can also choose armor. Armor is useful in its own right, but you need <i>twelve points of armor to reduce one point of damage</i>, approximately. To gain the same amount of "effective health" (as that is, in essence, all that armor is) as you do actual health from health scales, you would need <i>twelve times</i> the statistic. Therefore, if you are choosing to make a more tanky build, it is recommended to focus on health rather than armor.</i>
						<p>Thus, in short: If you are a melee dragon, use either strength or health base scales. For caster, use power or health. Hybrids can use a mix of power/strength scales or just full health techniqued with a variety of mix-matched statistics.</p>
						<p>On the line of techniques - <i>do not stress over them</i>. Until about tier three, techniques do so little to your statistics overall that it isn't that big of a deal to run with or without them. They do help, but they aren't necessary to your survival. For tiers three, four, and five, they become more important. (A full level 30 scaleset can, at most, provide you with +40 of a single statistic.)</p>
						<p>However, it is difficult to hunt down and craft all the necessary pieces for a full armor set, especially if you are a solo player entering a new tier. <b>Remember that having an unteched tier 4 scaleset is better than running a fully teched tier 2 scaleset.</b> If you cannot get your hands on a decked out scaleset, that is fine, but at least try and upgrade your armor to the next base level. If you don't have the crafting level, there are many people in the game who are likely willing to craft it for you provided you hunt the base components yourself if you want techniques. (Myself included, if you happen to run into me in-game!)</p>
						<p>I will not get too in depth into the actual process of creating and techniquing a scaleset as most of that is covered by in-game tutorials and the combinations are covered by the other build guide on this site. However, I want to bring up two important points to remember:</p>
						<p><i>Scale technique slots vary by tier.</i> Tier one and two can only have one technique, rendering them vastly useless.  Tier three and four have two, and tier five has three. (Repaired tier 6 scales have 2, but that is a unique case.) Be wary if you plan to tech your scales and use a program like Horizons Crafting Calculator!</p>
						<p><i>Only some scales can have sockets.</i> Socketed scales can hold crystals, which are dropped by various mobs (primarily Aegis-type enemies and undead). They are useful, but only if you have some on hand that have your skill. However, sockets can be dragged onto scales post-creation, so they are useful to have on hand regardless as they can be added in any spare technique slot without any crafting level. The scales that can hold sockets are chest and foreleg (armor slots) and head (jewelry) scales.</p>
					<p><b>Claws</b></p>
						<p>Claws are much simpler in comparison to scales, but they have a few things worth mentioning. Firstly, I will reiterate the important fact that claws <i>do not add to your damage!</i> It seems counterintuitive, and it may be, but it is how it is. Your actual damage comes from the 'Claw Mastery' passive you get from leveling up. Therefore, do not stress about adjusting claws every 6 or so levels; it is not that important.</p>
						<p>The real point of claws is to give dragons a place to technique a weapon with specific weapon-based effects, much like bipeds have swords or daggers. It is essentially another 'scale' to add a technique to, in terms of attributes and skills, but it can accept a few unique things.</p>
						<p>Claws can be socketed much like chest/foreleg/head scales, but they accept weapon (or claw) sockets. These sockets take weapon crystals, which can be just like regular armor crystals with stat boosts, or give unique on-hit effects such as extra damage procs. Any extra damage is better than none at all, so if you have a spare crystal with bonus damage around and nothing else to put on your claw, do so.</p>
						<p>Secondly, claws have a large selection of what's known as technique kits. These technique kits are techniques that can be crafted seperately from the item itself, and drag-n-dropped onto it later to apply. The formulas to create these are max level, so you will have to ask for them if you don't have high enough of a craft level, but the kits themselves are pretty useful. It is best for you to do your own research on what you personally prefer, as there are a good handful, but the most common choices are Battle-Forged for melee and Deadly for casters. Either or works for hybrids, as you cannot stack the tech kits.</p>
				<a name="summary"><header class="subsection border">Summary</header></a>
					<p>A basic summary, to conclude this drawn-out background information, is this:</p>
					<p>If you plan to build a <b>caster</b> dragon, focus on power, primal, and health. For <b>melee</b> - strength, tooth and claw, and health. <b>Hybrids</b> are a balanced combination between the two, becoming more viable the higher level you are and thus more numbers you can work with through scales.</p>
					<p>Do not worry about techniquing scales until tier three, and even then, it's more important to upgrade the base scales, even unteched, as you level. Higher-level older players are more than willing to help with non-technique related things.</p>
					<p>Claws do not affect your damage and don't need to be worried about more than a per-tier basis. If possible, add Deadly (caster) or Battle-Forged (melee) to your claws.</p>
		<a name="adventure"><header class="subsection border">Dragon Adventurer: Leveling Your Adventure School</header></a>
			<p>As the name not so subtly replies, Dragon Adventurer is your adventure school - and the only one you will ever have as a dragon. It is a relatively simple school, featuring a host of level-gated abilities and no necessarily complicated mechanics to wrap your mind around.</p>
			<p>You can reference which abilities you will gain as you level up from <a href="https://istariareference.com/schools.asp?school=Dragon+Adventurer">Istaria Reference's page</a> for the school. This also lists which stats you will gain per level-up and how many, as well as where the school NPCs are located. (For all intents and purposes, however, these school NPCs are relatively useless to your experience.)</p>
			<p>When you start leveling your adventure school, you will be going through the tutorial islands and end up at approximately level 10 to 15 when you reach Kion, the beginning of the open world and the main game. This is where our guide will start.</p>
			<p>Dragons are unique in the fact that they gain most of their powerful abilities through what are known as <i>ability quests</i>. A dragon without its abilities is essentially a fish out of water; you lack a vast majority of your harder hitting skills, your best heal, and useful passive abilities. Make sure you do your ability quests!</p>
			<p>These quests are also your best bet to leveling up. As you get the next version of an ability every 10 levels, and the quests are broken up into two staggered groups - ones that upgrade at level x0 and ones that upgrade at x5 - they provide an excellent (if relatively repetetive) structure to follow to  reach max level.</p>
			<p>Your first ability quests will be found in Kion, from the dragon on the vault roof named Gerix. Take and do all of the ones that give abilities. There are a few that he offers that are small story quests, which you can do too, but are less important than your ability quests. If you need help on the specifics of the quests, please refer to the informational websites for Istaria - the Lexica or the Wiki.</p>
			<p>After Kion, ability quests are split between two major cities - Dralk and Chiconis. These cities are where</p>
