				<a href="http://community.istaria.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?73-Player-Guides">Istaria Forums - Player Guides</a>
				<br/>
				This section of the forums is populated entirely by guides written by players for players. Many of these threads are very old and thus may contain out of date information, so read with caution, but a lot of information here still holds true.
				</li>
				<li>
				<a href="http://www.istaria-lexica.de/">Istaria Lexica</a>
				<br/>
				A newer MediaWiki-based website that was duplicated from the Istaria Wikia a few years ago and since has gained enough edits to be a unique generally up-to-date resource for general Istarian knowledge such as mobs, their drops, spawns, quest guides, and so on. Managed by Elteria and Terao.
				</li>
				<li>
				<a href="http://istariareference.com">Istaria Reference</a>
				<br/>
				A long-standing website managed by Cegaiel that contains a whole truckload of useful information from an entire Istarian map to a personal tracker for formulas.
				</li>
				<li>
				<a href="http://istaria.wikia.com">Istaria Wikia</a>
				<br/>
				The original Wikia for Istaria that has existed for years now. It is another resource for quests, mobs, loot tables, and the like. Managed by Calidavis / Kida.
				</li>
				<li>
				<a href="http://dalimondarchives.wikia.com">The Dalimond Archives</a>
				<br/>
				A newer wikia owned by Racktor that is meant to be an information hub regarding other people's characters and RP stories as well as a hub for the game's lore and stories. Meant as a replacement or successor to the Order Underground Wiki, an Order shard specific wiki that was the primary resource for character information for years, but locked down registration and moved to a new host.
