		<p>This page is a simple collection of useful links for anyone needing some guidance in Istaria. The page is in no particular order of preference and all links are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
		<header class="article border">Our Resources</header>
			<p>This section links out to guides and resources created by either our guild or by others that are very useful to players of Istaria. It is perfectly fine to place these on any information-hoarding websites such as the wikis, but if you do, we request that you link back to either this hub page, the website's main page, or the resources's specific page and give credit to the author.</p>
