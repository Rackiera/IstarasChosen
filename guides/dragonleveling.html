		<p>Dragons are notoriously easy to level, though it might not seem like that at first. Every x0 and x5 levels, they have a crop of quests pop up that allow them to upgrade their abilities to keep them progressing through adventure levels with little grind when compared to bipeds, who are generally forced to do story quests or slaughter mobs for hours. Like other races, dragons also have a crop of town marshall and trophy hunter quests available to them every five levels.</p>
		<p>The best way to level a dragon is to complete the aforementioned quests every time they're available as soon as you can. Keeping on top of your abilities will not only make you more effective in battle, but will also give you easy EXP. Most of these quests will be available until level 100 every 5 levels, though they will begin to peter out after level 80. </p>
