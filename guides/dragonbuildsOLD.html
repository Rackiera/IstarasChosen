				<p style="font-size:.75em">Written by Machaeon, February 16th 2015</p>
				<p>Melee builds are great for doing lots of damage in a short amount of time and many people enjoy this play style. Personally though, I find them a bit boring as a 'one trick pony'. They mainly use attacks like Gold Rage, Silver Strike, Ravage, Drain Strike, Bite, Tail Whip, Galewind, and the generic attack you get from hitting the 'fight' button.</p>

				<p>Melee builds focus heavily on strength and tooth & claw. Investing training points in these skills is good if you want a melee dragon, both of these will increase your damage output for the above mentioned attacks. Dexterity and health are important as well, though aren't usually focused on heavily. Dexterity determines how often you hit your opponents and health of course determines how much damage you can take.</p>

				<p>Good scales are essential for any build, here are some suggestions for what to put on your gear:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Some favor strength based scales with tooth and claw, dexterity, and armor or health techniques applied. These scales will maximize your damage output but will result in a dragon vulnerable to enemy attacks that do a lot of damage, especially if you don't invest training points in health. Wearing scales like these will mean that your enemies at or above your level can and will kill you quickly if you don't kill them first but the fact that you do a lot of damage in scales like these may make that a fair tradeoff.</li>
						<li>Others like health based scales with tooth and claw, strength, and dexterity (possibly armor substituted in place of dexterity) techniques applied. Scales like these increase the amount of damage your dragon can take so you can fight longer without dying. Depending on how you invest your training points, these may be one of the best options. If you don't invest training points in health, these are good for making up that deficit.</li>
						<li>Still others like armor based scales with tooth and claw, strength, and dexterity (possibly health substituted in place of dexterity) techniques applied. These scales are similar to the ones above in that they extend the survivability of your dragon. Armor of course reduces the damage directed against you so you actually receive less damage. (Armor scales are a favorite of mine and I usually use armor scales as a base regardless of build.)</li>
						<li>With any combination of the above scales it's important not to forget that some scales can be socketed (head scales, chest scales, and foreleg scales) and that crystals can often give better bonuses than techniques. Also techniques like razor teeth (head scale only- gives a higher chance to hit with the Bite attack and increases its damage) and piercing winds (wing scales only- gives your Galewind attack more chance to hit and increases its damage). Other, unique techniques found from various quests are always something to consider as well, be careful when applying them since you only get them once and will otherwise have to invest a LOT of time into getting a replacement from town marshall quests.

					</ul>
				<p>Different people like different things when it comes to claws, personally I like having either Rending (applies a bleed effect that does damage over time), Sharper (increases your chance to hit your target and your damage), or Battle Forged (increases tooth and claw skill and your damage) applied to the claw and any remaining technique slots used for sockets. Sockets make any claw flexible since you can swap out the crystal for the occasion and a strength crystal for your tier will always give you more than a strength technique for your tier. However, if you don't like sockets or can't find crystals to make a socket useful, tooth and claw/strength/dexterity/health/armor techniques are always good to put on a melee dragon's claw. Also keep in mind that there are unique quested techniques that can be applied to claws as above with scales, it's entirely up to you on whether you use these or not. I normally fight with my Sharper V + socket + scocket claw and have the uniquely teched claws ready for occasions where I would need them.</p>

				<p style="font-size:.75em">Written by Machaeon, February 16th 2015</p>
				<p>Hybrid builds are absolutely the most varied and most flexible dragon build out there. Generally speaking, hybrids should be able to use melee attacks and spells fairly well, not relying overly much on one or the other. They are a mix of caster and melee and therefore use the full range of attacks and spells well, hence the hybrid name.</p>

				<p>Hybrids tend to focus equally on primal, tooth and claw, power, and strength; though variation is always possible. Focus, dexterity, and health may or may not be focused on as well, depending on what you want out of your dragon. (Machaeon has a build where training points are spread as equally as possible between primal, tooth and claw, power, strength, focus, dexterity, and health. I don't usually have problems hunting anything on my own that isn't an epic with this build.)</p>

				<p>What to put on your scales can be a bit confusing with hybrids though generally putting caster and melee techniques equally on the scales is a good start. I personally recommend using armor base scales and using power/strength, primal/tooth and claw, focus/dexterity techs spread out on all your scales. Socketing all possible scales is always a good option in my opinion, since you can always swap out the crystals to fit the occasion.</p>

				<p>Claws are a bit tricky with hybrids as well, what you put on them is basically dependent on what you want out of your dragon. Personally I love using Sharper (increases your chance to hit your target and your damage) and using sockets for any remaining technique slots. However it may be a good idea to have a variety of claws with different techniques on each to see what works best for you and what you like to use... also having a large selection of claws makes you more flexible since you have more options to work with.</p>

				<p>I highly recommend keeping ALL your ability quests up to date with your level for any builds, hybrids in particular since they thrive on using variety.</p>

				<p>Lastly, experimentation is always good with hybrid builds. There is no real definite build for a hybrid and a variety of training point investment strategies are viable options. Try new things, see what you like and go with that!</p>

				<p style="font-size:.75em">Written by Machaeon, February 16th 2015</p>
				<p><b>With the introduction of the new dragon spells in October 2017, this guide requires updating.</b></p>
				<p>Caster dragons are great for doing damage over time, healing effectively for a dragon, getting the best use of spells and breath attacks, and taking out multiple enemies at once. Casters do most of their damage with spells and breath abilities, though I have noticed they tend to get more damage out with spiked scales than a non-caster build. Epic spells become quite useful in the claws of a caster whereas in the claws of a melee dragon they are just shiny spell effects that do a wee bit of damage. Personally I adore casters for their challenge, it's much more entertaining for me to play a caster than a melee dragon but that's just me.</p>

				<p>Casters focus mostly on power and primal when investing training points, both of these will increase the effectiveness of spells and power increases the damage output for all your breath attacks. Focus and health are definitely something to throw a few training points at but aren't generally heavily invested in, focus determines how often your spells hit what you point them at and health of course determines how much damage you can take before you die.</p>

				<p>With casters it is VITAL to keep your spells up to date and preferably techniqued if you can. (If you are having difficulty with this or can't find all the forms to make the spells, contact me in-game and I will help you out.) A must-have for any decent caster is definitely Drain Bolt which does comparable damage to an un-teched version of improved prime bolt suitable to your level but also heals you as you damage your opponent, you can get this spell from quests given by Khemarius outside of Kirasanct. Also try to get your breath attack quests done as soon as you can. You start out with breath of fire I, gain breath of fire II when you ascend to adult, and gain breath of fire III from a level 60 quest after completing the breath of ice quest that you can pick up at level 50 and starts at your faction leader (Semeneth if you are Helian or Valkoth if you are Lunus) they will send you to Kelakhan in the mountains near the southwestern end of the Spirituous Swamp. Kelakhan will be the starting point for all the breath attack quests after breath of ice. After the level 60 quest breath of fire III you get breath of lightning at level 80 and breath of acid at level 100. The final breath attack in the game is breath of flame burst which is given to you once you ascend to ancient. Primal Cast is definitely something to go after as well (it gives any ranged spell or breath attack the chance to hit three times) you can pick up Primal Cast from Naithis the Watcher at the top of the Tower of Magery, it is a very simple quest and the target can be killed instantly if you have Gold Rage VII (which you should have since the quest is only available at level 100 and GR VII is available at level 70).</p>

				<p>Scales are a vital part of any dragon character, here are some suggestions of what to put on your scales to improve your caster experience:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Power base scales with primal, focus, and health or armor techniques applied are great if you want your spells to be as strong as possible. However this will mean your dragon will be susceptible to enemy attacks that do a lot of damage, especially if you don't invest much in health. While wearing scales like these, it is very important to keep an eye on your health and have healing spells ready whenever possible. When fighting something at or above your level you will find it challenging in these scales to stay alive while killing the creature, but the amount of damage this adds to your spells may be a fair tradeoff for the extra risk involved.</li>
					<li>Health based scales with power, primal, and focus (perhaps armor substituted in place of focus) techniques applied are a good way to get around the above problem without lowering your damage output too significantly. Scales like these increase the amount of damage your dragon can take so you can fight longer without dying. Depending on how you invest your training points, these may be one of the best options. If you don't invest training points in health, these are good for making up that deficit.</li>
					<li>Armor based scales with power, primal, and focus (or health substituted in place of focus) techniques applied are also a good option to keep your dragon alive longer. These scales are similar to the ones above in that they extend the survivability of your dragon. Armor of course reduces the damage directed against you so you actually receive less damage. (Armor scales are a favorite of mine and I usually use armor scales as a base regardless of build.)</li>
					<li>With any combination of the above scales it's important not to forget that some scales can be socketed (head scales, chest scales, and foreleg scales) and that crystals can often give better bonuses than techniques. Also techniques like razor teeth (head scale only- gives a higher chance to hit with the Bite attack and increases its damage) and piercing winds (wing scales only- gives your Galewind attack more chance to hit and increases its damage). Other, unique techniques found from various quests are always something to consider as well, be careful when applying them since you only get them once and will otherwise have to invest a LOT of time into getting a replacement from town marshall quests.

				<p>Different people like different things when it comes to claws, personally I like having either Rending (applies a bleed effect that does damage over time), Sharper (increases your chance to hit your target and your damage), or Deadly (increases your damage with spells) applied to the claw and any remaining technique slots used for sockets. Sockets make any claw flexible since you can swap out the crystal for the occasion and a power crystal for your tier will always give you more than a power technique for your tier. However, if you don't like sockets or can't find crystals to make a socket useful, primal/power/focus/health/armor techniques are always good to put on a caster dragon's claw. Also keep in mind that there are unique quested techniques that can be applied to claws as above with scales, it's entirely up to you on whether you use these or not. I normally fight with my Sharper V + socket + scocket claw and have the uniquely teched claws ready for occasions where I would need them.</p>

			<a name="tank"><header class="subsection border">Tank Build</header></a>
				<p style="font-size:.75em">Written by Machaeon, February 16th 2015</p>
				<p>Tank build dragons are generally similar to melee dragons but invest more into health than into strength or tooth and claw. The idea behind tank dragons is to be able to survive a walloping while still doing a good amount of damage yourself. These are great for keeping the attention of an epic mob (Reklar, Valkor, Son of Gigaroth, Shaloth, Elial, etc.) and preventing the epic from targeting and destroying other members of the group needed to hunt them.</p>

				<p>One tank build strategy is to invest one training point into strength, one into tooth and claw, and the remaining five into health each time you level. This is just one strategy, the only one I've used so far, and I'm quite sure there are many other viable options for building a tank dragon.</p>

				<p>Armor and/or health based scales are a must for tank builds. Adding on tooth and claw, strength, and dexterity to the scales is a good idea. Socket all available scales (head, chest, forelegs) and put health and/or armor crystals for your level range in each socket. Depending on what you end up hunting regularly, it may be beneficial to have a scale set with ethereal armor as one of the techniques applied since some creatures do exclusively ethereal damage which ignores all regular armor when doing damage.</p>


				<p>(This is definitely the build I have had the least experience with and one of the builds I haven't seen all that often either.)</p>
