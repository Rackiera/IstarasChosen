		<p>First thing you should know about bipeds is that they have a HUGE selection of schools to choose from and thus will have a vast number of ways to play effectively.</p>
		<p>Secondly, leveling a biped properly will require a lot more effort than leveling a dragon. Bipeds do not have the luxury of ability quests every ten levels like dragons do.</p>

		<p>As a personal recommendation, I suggest leveling Cleric (or later Healer) at least a little bit so you can use at least some healing spells in the school of your choice. Regardless of which adventure school(s) you decide to go with, the best way to level your biped is to grab every last quest you can find, take advantage of town marshall quests, and absolutely use every trophy quest there is. Once you get one school to 100 it becomes both easier and harder to level other schools. Confusing? Let me elaborate: it gets easier because in the school you get to 100 you can generally hunt anything that drops trophies, gather massive amounts of them and then switch schools to turn them in; it gets harder because of your rating, your rating determines the amount of experience you get from any kill and with a high enough rating you will get zero experience from killing something that is actually at your current level in a school. Once your rating gets high enough, trophies become the only real option to leveling unless you like killing things over and over, only getting a fraction of the experience needed to level for each kill.</p>

		<p>Crafting with bipeds is very important, if you can make the gear you need, you will definitely survive better. Blacksmith and Outfitter are definitely the top of the list of craft schools to level. Blacksmiths make tools (which are vital to any craft school) and basic weapons, Outfitters make backpacks (increase your carrying capacity) and backpack pouches (useful to sort your inventory) and basic armors and clothing. You will need both to fight effectively in any school or you will need to find a player that does have these schools leveled.</p>

		<p>To get all craft schools to 100, I recommend starting with Blacksmith since this is the school that makes all the tools for every other school and without tools you can't really do much. For leveling Blacksmith, make and deconstruct tools in either stone or metal depending on the tier. Once you get Blacksmith to 100, you can level schools that work with metal, wood, and stone fairly quickly by processing mithril and marble. Getting Outfitter to 100 should be your next priority, use metal armor wherever possible to level Outfitter since you already have skill from Blacksmith to help you out with that. With Outfitter and Blacksmith at level 100, you can work fairly well with fabric, metal, wood, and stone. At this point, you will want to start making sets of cloth armor techniqued to raise your basic skills to get as close to optimum as possible with gathering and processing t5 resources. </p>

		<p>Since your goal is to make techniqued cloth armor, you will definitely want to level Tailor so you can make triple-techniqued t5 cloth armor which you can wear in any school so long as at least one of your current schools is at or above level 81. Tailor is very easy to level since you can already work with t5 cloth, easiest way is to simply process ironsilk at Fabric Isle. At this point, you can make craft armor to boost all of your skills that you can wear in any school so long as one of your schools is at or above 81. I would heavily recommend making craft suits for every skill you need for your schools of interest as you level them, this will allow you to level faster and work with higher tier materials quickly. With Blacksmith, Outfitter, and Tailor leveled you should have the basics to start leveling any other school you need or want to work with. Jeweler should be next on your list so you can have jewelry to match your armor, simply grind mithril bars until around level 80 then you should be making jewelry until level 100. Scholar might be your next priority so you can work with essence and craft spells and scrolls for yourself, this will be simple since Blacksmith gives you enough skill to work with marble; a suit techniqued with quarrying, stoneworking, and spellcraft would be very beneficial if your next goal is leveling Scholar. Grind marble bricks until you get bored enough to go back a tier or two and craft spells for a while or simply grind bricks until you can make marble spell shards and make t5 spells until level 100. </p>

		<p>With those 5 schools at 100, you should be mostly self-sufficient save for making triple-techniqued weapons and (non-cloth) armor. Level Armorer with metal for your heavy armor, Fletcher with wood for your wooden weapons, and Weaponsmith for your metal weapons. Miner and Gatherer can also be leveled alongside the schools you want to improve your gathering abilities, switch to Miner (if you want to level it) when processing metal, stone, or gems and switch to Gatherer (if you want to level it) when processing wood, fabric, or essence. However keep in mind that both Miner and Gatherer will raise your salvaging skill high enough where it may hurt the xp in other schools, though not as high as Tinkerer does (Tinkerer should be saved for last if you want to level all schools or last out of the schools you do want to level.) </p>

		<p>The 5 building schools are fairly straightforward: Mason works exclusively in stone, Fitter works exclusively in metal, Carpenter works exclusively in wood, Weaver works exclusively in fabric, and Enchanter works exclusively in essence. If you have already leveled Miner and Gatherer enough to work with t6 materials before you start building then leveling these schools will be very easy. You can simply process raw materials until you can start building with higher-tier materials. None of these are the slightest bit necessary unless you want to build a plot or you want the Grand Master Crafter title. However Fitter is desirable because with it at 100, you have a base strength of 1000, same goes for Weaver with dexterity.</p>

		<p>Confectioner, Tinkerer, and Alchemist are some of the... well let's call them "irritating" schools to level since the vast majority of the forms that these schools use require 3 different materials or more. You can however level them easily if you know what you're doing. Starting with Alchemist, you'll want to use the highest tier of essence you can process into orbs to start off, and after you're sufficiently leveled to start making t5 potions and dyes then you can simply mass-produce those to get the last few levels knocked out. With Alchemist leveled, you can easily level Confectioner without touching a single food formula. All you need is the expert crystal vial formula that you get from a level 80 Alchemist quest at the Bruitten Homestead north of Mithril's Anvil. Make tons of the crimson vials, you can either sell those to a pawnbroker for easy coin or use them to make Athala's Sweet Brews to level Alchemist more (you'll get that form in the same quest to get the crystal vial form). Tinkerer can be leveled a good ways simply by processing mithril or adamantium ore into bars but it's faster to use the crystal vial form again past the first 40 levels or so.</p>


		<p>As a side note, you should keep in mind that every year since the 10th anniversary, the Istarian development team has arranged events at the end of every year (typically late December to early January) where all experience gain is doubled. In this time, it is the most effective to level your more challenging schools or make the adventure grind less grindy even with a high rating.</p>
