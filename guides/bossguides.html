			<p>Epic monsters are the final boss monsters in Istaria. They are seperated into two categories: greater and lesser. These do not distinguish levels of difficulty, but rather levels of reward. Greater bosses give a greater reward and are involved in the creation of epic weapons and armor, dropping essences required in these. Lesser bosses don't give any essences or have any related weapons or armor, but they still drop epic tokens, some crates, and count for their own daily and part of the weekly quest.</p>
			<p>As of right now, the epics are categorized as such:</p>

			<p>Each individual epic has its own set of abilities that make it unique and differentiates each fight. Most notable are the greater epics, who are the most different with specific tactics, but lesser epics are generally more alike. While there certainly are unique lesser epics, the majority of them are relatively samey.</p>
			<p>In the upcoming sections, I will address what the general tactics are for fighting each boss, what is usually recommended for a group composition, and other details specific to each boss, beginning with greater epics.</p>
			<p>Note: I am not the be all and end all of epic fighting. If you have any observations, suggestions, or tactics you think are good here, feel free to suggest them to me and I will gladly add in any valid tactics.</p>

			<p>Of the fourteen epics in the game, eight of them are greaters. As mentioned earlier, greater epics are defined as a subcategory of epic monsters that have their own specific epic item sets tailored in their visual theme and that drop greater rewards (chances of large crates, higher chances of medium crates, epic essences).</p>

				<p>Falgut the Slaver is an epic added with the Niesa's Fate update in 2016. He has a few notable mechanics as well as a very sizable health pool (approximately 1,000,000 HP) and multiple followers known as Slaver's Guards (each with 87,300 HP). His resistances and weaknesses force you to use a Violet Damage Crystal of Blight to maximize your damage. The drawback - a lack of Primal resistance - shouldn't bother you in the slightest. Unfortunately, no damage converter spells target his weaknesses; his elemental resistances prevent this.</p>
				<p>You have to use Shards (or slivers) of Freedom to fight Falgut. He has an AoE aura called "Enslaved", which prevents you from doing anything - even recalling. The 'Freedom' buff counteracts this and is only available through the Shards or Slivers. The Slivers are dropped from monsters nearby Falgut's tower when using Inspire Freedom. 5 Slivers make a Shard, which has 10 uses that gives a 10-minute buff per use. You will want at least one shard for a fight, depending on how many players you have. Two or three is safer, but you may be able to scrape by with one.</p>
				<p>Fighting Falgut himself is pretty easy, just very long. Simply kill his adds when they spawn, and then focus all your high-damaging abilities on Falgut himself. He will occasionally use an ability that will strip the Freedom buff from a party member. When he does this, another party member must use their shard <i>on</i> the affected person to allow them to act again. Otherwise, they must leave his Enslavement aura's range and re-use their own shard.</p>
