		<p>Firstly, your dragon is only as good as what you invest in it. Your gear can make or break your dragon's usefulness, do your best to keep your gear as close to your current level as possible. (If you are having difficulty with this or simply need something you can't make yet, let me know in-game and I can see what I can do. I may require that you help gather the technique components for techniqued gear.)</p>

		<p>For gaining adventure experience, dragons get tutorial quests on Skalkaar and New Trismus and ability quests every ten levels from trainers in Kion (first set of ability quests only), Chiconis, and Dralk. These quests will give you the vast majority of experience needed to progress from level to level. </p>

		<p>Trophy hunters offer quests to gather trophies from specified creatures in exchange for experience and coin at all levels and are always good supplements to ability quests for gaining experience. All trophy quests are infinitely repeatable and require 5 trophies to complete, the first 5 times you do one specific trophy quest you get twice the usual experience and every repetition after that always gives you the same amount of experience and coin. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>At levels 1-10 Jeremiah Trueheart on New Trismus offers you trophy quests for creatures on New Trismus.</li>
						<li>At levels 11-20 Kairos in Kion, Lagontus in Sslanis, and Farmer Idamon will offer you trophy quests for creatures on Lesser Aradoth. (Note: Farmer Idamon is the only one who will take Giant Chicken Tail Feathers)</li>
						<li>At levels 21-40 Trienna in Dalimond and Baltorros in Chiconis will offer you trophy quests for creatures in the Dalimond (Peninsula)/Bristugo/Chiconis/Abandoned Island areas.</li>
						<li>At levels 41-60 Gruntour in Mahagra and Nomentu in New Rachival will offer you trophy quests for creatures in the Mahagra/Tazoon/New Rachival/Heather/Trandalar/Aughundell areas.</li>
						<li>At levels 61-80 Garanthos in Dralk, Diadrus in Kirasanct, and Arionn in Feladan will offer you trophy quests for creatures in the Dralk/Kirasanct/Feladan/Dikania Island areas.</li>
						<li>At levels 81-100 Drannor in Aughundell will offer you trophy quests for creatures in various areas, many being around Harro or Morning Light.</li>
					</ul>
		<p>I highly recommend exploring as much as possible, there are many side quests out there that not only give you experience (sometimes with coin) but can also have unique rewards that pay off in the long run or are just good to have.</p>

		<p>If after completing your ability quests for your level range and are having difficulty getting trophies for trophy quests or are having difficulty getting experience in general, find creatures (preferably above your level) that you can kill in a reasonable amount of time and just spend your time hunting these until the problem that caused you to have trouble getting experience is resolved by leveling.</p>

		<p>Please note that hoard is vital for dragons, it fuels many of our abilities and gives an armor/damage bonus if you have a certain amount of hoard for your level. Hoard is dropped by semi-intelligent creatures such as pygmies/ogres (anything with a name something'kuk or something'guk), skulks, withered aegis/undead, blighted constructs, maggots, and kwellen. More information on hoard is provided here.</p>

		<p>For gaining dragon crafter experience, the tutorial quests on Skalkaar and New Trismus should get you to roughly 10 craft. After that, Xarinnis gives you your first mastery quests, at 20 craft the various trainers in Dralk and Chiconis begin giving you mastery quests and do so every ten levels (Each craft skill not including ingenuity has its own trainer either in Dralk or Chiconis). Mastery quests give you some experience but do little to advance craft levels overall. To get serious experience requires repeatedly gathering as much material as possible, processing it, deconstructing the products, and repeating. Wherever possible use formulas that are as close to your current skill as you can find. At least try to keep your mastery quests up to date with your craft level, it makes your job so much easier. These are my personal recommendations for leveling craft quickly:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For levels 1-35 sandstone is your best friend. I recommend using the plot at Nuthala once you are able to survive the level 16-18 golems at the quarry, it has 4 open silos, a vault, and journeyman machines. Craft and deconstruct spells, always use the spell form that takes the highest skill to scribe. (Beginner formulas are sold by Kerian on New Trismus, Xarinnis in Kion, and Resiata in Chiconis.)</li>
						<li>For levels 35-50 slate is easiest to work with. On Order, I recommend using either the plot at Snowfall south of Mahagra or the plot at Central Valley, both have open silos and journeyman machines. Central valley has rich nodes whereas Snowfall does not but Snowfall has a vault whereas Central Valley does not, neither have any golems to worry about. On Chaos, Slate Crest has a vault and a shop as well as motherlodes nearby, but it's guarded by golems. Craft and deconstruct scales, strength scale forms are sold by craft trainers and power scale forms are dropped by 'semi-intelligent' creatures, use power forms if you have them when you are able.</li>
						<li>For levels 70-80 cobalt is arguably the easiest to work with, I recommend using the lair north of Dralk that has Dalgan standing outside it, the lair has two silos a lair room and t2 machines. No rich nodes or motherlodes are anywhere nearby but this is the only place that has both storage and machines near the resources. At this point it is advisable to make mining/smelting scales to speed up the whole process if you have not already, you will thank yourself for the effort invested in the scales. Craft scales, same as the previous level range. (Note: this is the most annoying tier to level with as there are no great options and one decent option. If you need further information or other options, speak to me in-game.)</li>
						<li>For levels 80-100 mithril is the best option. Pretty much everyone uses the plot nearest the mithril at Mithril's Anvil for this range so this isn't so much of a recommendation as established practice. If you have not done so at this point, do yourself a favor and make a set of mining/smelting/scalecraft scales. It is pretty much required at this point to do anything at optimum. Craft and deconstruct scales, use focus ones if you have the forms. (Expert forms are sold by Queriatia in Dralk.)</li>
					</ul>

		<p>For gaining dragon lairshaper experience, firstly you need to join the lairshaper school. To join the lairshaper school you must have at least 22 craft levels and talk to Queriatia in Dralk, you will be sent north of Dralk to Relstaroth's Lair. Relstaroth will take over there and teach you the basics in a few quests. You get lairshaping mastery quests from Relstaroth and crystalshaping mastery quests from Balennos every ten lairshaper levels. As with dragon crafter, it pays to keep these quests up to date with your level. I highly recommend AGAINST joining this school before reaching 100 craft, it is really not worth the frustration of starting this school at level 22 craft trust me.</p>

		<p>Each tier of lairshaping materials has two groups of formulas: easier ones (excoriations, primal essences, and imbued bars) that only require two types of materials and harder ones (lattices, maelstones, and flowstones) which require three types of materials and two steps of processing. Personally I prefer using the easier ones to level with simply because they require less materials and therefore less effort to make, though you get more experience from the harder ones. Change tiers of materials when you are able to, this will ensure you get the best experience output from creating materials. Most of your experience in this school comes from applying materials to unfinished lair rooms, if you do not have a lair or cannot purchase one, please note that asking around in Marketplace will lead you towards people who do have lairs that need work done on and even if you can't find work for your tier, applying materials is not at all necessary for leveling.</p>

		<p>For gaining dragon crystalshaper experience, you must first join the crystalshaper school. To join, you must have at least 80 adventure and 20 lairshaping levels. Once you meet the requirements, talk to Ristef the Peacemaker at the Council of Ancients outside of Dralk. This will start the attunement quest for the Fiery Rift. Once you complete the quest line you can port to the Fiery Rift where the crystalshaper trainer Aratanosh is found. I highly, HIGHLY recommend getting to a high lairshaper level before doing any significant work with the crystalshaper school. At 100 craft and 100 lairshaping, you can very easily power through the crystalshaper school by simply processing t6 unfocused azulyte crystals into focused azulyte. (This whole process only took me a week or two using mainly t6 azulyte, and that's impressive considering how much time is required for the other craft schools.) Regardless, the fastest way to level crystalshaper is not to bother with crafting large numbers of the actual consumable crystals, rather just process the highest tier of azulyte you can gather.</p>
