		<p>Dragons are Istaria's flagship race. Its entire marketing is based around them, so to play one, you must be really good and know how to do everything right or else you die, correct? Actually, no - dragons are notoriously easy to level and understand. Unlike bipeds, who have nearly fifty schools all combined between adventure and crafting, dragons only have one adventure school and three crafting schools. They have a very smooth set path for leveling if you follow ability quests and gain the power of flight - an extremely useful skill for traverseing terrain - quite early. If you are new to Istaria, the best place to start learning the game is certainly a dragon. Without further ado, let's begin.</p>
		<p>The first thing to know when starting up a dragon is that you are strong. In lower levels, be careful not to overestimate yourself, but your power scales up dramatically as you unlock new scale slots and upgrade your equipment. When you start, you may struggle to take down even the little grulets in Skalkaar, but by level thirty you can easily smack down level fifties if you know how to work your abilities. Level fifties and sixties can take down the highest level enemies in the game, shy of epics. As a group, dragons are unstoppable. Alone, they’re still formidable. Take advantage of that!</p>
		<p>That being said, the second thing to be aware of is what path you want to take. There’s multiple ways to level a dragon; they only have one adventure school and one primary craft school and thus are considerably easier than the much squishier and more complex bipeds. Do you want to not bother with upgrading your scales as you go and wish to slaughter enemies even at level one? Level your craft to eighty or ninety first and equip tier five scales - nothing will stand in your way for a very long time. Hate crafting and just want to run ahead? That works too. Dragons are notoriously flexible when it comes to leveling strategies; make use of that!</p>
		<p>Regardless of what crafting path you take, leveling adventure is very similar all the same. Before we delve into the actual leveling aspect of playing a dragon, let's consider the basic build mechanics and how setting up your training points and scales works.</p>
		<a name="build"><header class="subsection border">Making a Build - Training Points and Scales</header></a>
		<p>Before we start, let’s cover their basic statistics and skills so you understand what you’re looking at in your training points window. We go far more in detail with this on the <a href="http://istaraschosen.com/guides/dragonbuilds.html">Dragon Build Guides</a> page, so check that out if that is more what you’re looking for. This is a simple overview!</p>
		<p>The first encounter with creating a build you will have is with your training points. Training points are points that you can spend in exchange for certain statisics. Listed below are the available stats you can skill.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Strength:</b> Directly increases physical damage. Costs 4 points.</li>
			<li><b>Power:</b> Directly increases magic damage. Costs 4 points.</li>
			<li><b>Primal:</b> Increases damage of spells that use the primal skill. (Essentially all dragon spells) Costs 3 points.</li>
			<li><b>Tooth and Claw:</b> Increases damage of physical attacks that use the tooth and claw skill. (Essentially all attacks) Costs 3 points.</li>
			<li><b>Dexterity:</b> Increases your to-hit chance with physical abilities and decreases an enemy's. Costs 4 points.</li>
			<li><b>Focus:</b> Increases your to-hit chance with magic abilities and decreases an enemy's. Costs 4 points.</li>
			<li><b>Health:</b> Directly increases your health pool. Costs 1 point.</li>
			<li><b>Evasion:</b> Increases your chance to dodge an enemy's physical attack. Costs 3 points.</li>
			<li><b>Magic Evasion:</b> Increases your chance to dodge an enemy's magical attack. Costs 3 points.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>From this list, you'll notice two major distinctions: magic and physical damage. Depending on what you want to play as - a dragon spellcaster or a physical attacker/melee dragon - you will want to skill specific stats related to it. If you are a melee-focused character, then don't put anything in primal, power, or focus. Regardless of which category you are looking for, do not skill anything into the evasions, dexterity, or focus - these statistics are largely useless to you and do not make enough of a notable difference.</p>
		<p>Especially when leveling, the unique statitic health is very useful to skill. If you put a lot of points into health, you will directly see those points returned as hitpoint. 600 training points into health means 600 hit points.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind when skilling statistics that you can only ever place half of your maximum points into one category, limiting you to fully filling two bars.</p>
