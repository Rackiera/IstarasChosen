		<b>Rite of Passage Calculator</b> <br> <i style='font-size:.75em;'>12/03/19</i> <br> <div class='seperator'></div>
				<p>The <a href="/resources/ropcalculator.php">RoP calculator</a> has been finished and is now available, bug-free, to be used to calculate the lowest craft you possibly need to do the RoP at any adventure level for either faction!</p>
		<b>Reformatting II</b> <br> <i style='font-size:.75em;'>12/03/19</i> <br> <div class='seperator'></div>
				<p>Reformatting has been overall finished. 'Guides' and 'Istarian Resources' have combined into 'Guides & Resources'. All old guides pages now redirect to the new location. All guides and tools have been given a small description as to what they do before you click to give you an idea of what you're getting into. Finally, the main page has been updated to reflect the current state of our guild and site.</p>

		<b>Reformatting</b> <br> <i style='font-size:.75em;'>12/01/19</i> <br> <div class='seperator'></div>
				<p>The site is undergoing some reformatting to make it more focused on the game itself rather than just our guild. I hope to make it a useful resource rather than an advertisement site.</p>

		<b>Guide Pages Reformatted</b> <br> <i style='font-size:.75em;'>4/27/18</i> <br> <div class='seperator'></div>
				<p>The guide pages have been reformatted to follow the main site's style, hopefully to make them easier to read.</p>
